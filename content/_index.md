**Kennel Linux** (KL) is a family of Linux distributions that is shared and discussed on the [Puppy Linux Discussion Forum](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewforum.php?f=228).
They are usually, but not necessarily, built with the FirstRib build system (created by wiak), which is a collection of shell scripts that builds a root filesystem to boot with some bootloader (e.g. GRUB).

There are many KL distros, each with their own unique features:
- **KLV:** Any KL distro based on [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/). Probably the most popular of these is [KLV-Airedale](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewforum.php?f=191), created by rockedge.
- **KLA:** Any KL distro based on Arch Linux.
- **KLU:** Any KL distro based on Ubuntu. Currently, the only KLU is [KLU-jam-XFCEbase](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=7866), created by wiak.
- **KLF:** Any KL distro based on Fedora. Currently, the only KLF is [KLF-Rawhide-CE](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=9389), created by Sofiya.
- **KL minis:** KL distros that are made to be "very small".
